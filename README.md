# Hey hey, here's my submission for the second week's homework.
It should be noted that there are a handful of design/color palette tweaks to wrap up eventually, but here are the features currently implemented.

# Features
- Nav bar buttons transition on hover, jump to respective point on the page.
- Contact button transitions on hover, jumps to external page with "back to main page" button.
- Image links transition on hover. 
- Footer media buttons transition on hover, jump to external pages in new tabs.
- Back to top button.
- I added a youtube embed in the "About" section with a custom scroll bar.
- Form buttons transition on hover.

# Responsive Design 
- The page is set to collapse into a column when shrunk below 992 px. It's just what I felt was best for my layout.
I added ordering and flex to ensure the page collapses how I intended.
- On page shrink, inline flex header and nav bar will collapse into columns- The footer will re-position the back to top button and realign media links to center.

# Notes
- There's alot of design tweaks to be had down the line- definitely gonna keep adding to this down the line.
- Forgive my abuse of divs. It's just preference, especially when reverse engineering websites that primarily use divs.
